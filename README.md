# rainbowDice
Rainbow dice is a dice rolling program aimed at supporting any game requiring dice including roll playing games.
Gamers can specify the number of dice, the number of sides, what number each die starts at and whether two consecutive
dice definitions should have their results added or subtracted.  Currently all dice have numeric values on their sides.
Specifying other symbols is not possible.  But you can choose the increment to be something other than 1.
