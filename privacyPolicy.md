# Rainbow Dice: Privacy Policy

Rainbow Dice does not collect any user data for any reason.  It does not
require any permissions other than accelerometer usage.  The accelerometer
data is only used to roll the dice (creates randomness and gravity measurements
cause the dice to bounce toward the screen).
